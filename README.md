## *Detailed Description*

---

## Frequency Table

> **The first part of the project reads three links of e-books then calculates a table of frequencies for letters with ASCII from 0 to 127 and creates a frequencies.dat file with the output.**

---

## Huffman Tree Implementation

> **The second part of the project reads from the frequencies.dat file the frequency table, adds it to a priority queue and produces a Huffman tree**

---

## Codification Implementation

> **The third part of the project reads from the tree.dat file the huffman tree and then traverses it and creates the coding with 1 and 0 for every ASCII character. Finallly the result is written to a codes.dat file.**

---

## Encoder

> **The fourth part of the project reads an input file from the command line written in ascii coding and creates an output file based on the input but in huffman coding(run main from AppEncoder class).**

---

## Decoder

> **The fifth and last part of the project reads an input file from the command line written in huffman coding and creates an output file based on the input but in ascii coding(run main from AppDecoder class).**
